# Performance Analysis and Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms in Financial Services Applications

## Overview
This research project evaluates and compares the performance of various machine learning algorithms applied to real-world use cases in financial services, including:
- **Fraud Detection**
- **Customer Churn Prediction**
- **Credit Risk Profiling**

## Focus Area
My primary contribution was in the **classification tasks**, where I applied and assessed different supervised learning algorithms for fraud detection and churn prediction.

## Classification Algorithms Used
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Datasets
- **Online Payment Fraud Detection**: Kaggle dataset with features such as transaction type, amount, and account balances.
- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Kaggle dataset including features like age, credit score, tenure, and account activity.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding, and scaling.
2. **Model Training**: Training multiple classification models on prepared datasets.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score

## Key Findings
- **Random Forest** consistently outperformed other algorithms, providing the best balance of precision, recall, and overall accuracy across both fraud detection and churn prediction tasks.
- **SVM** showed high precision but struggled with imbalanced data.
- **Logistic Regression** underperformed due to its linear assumptions.
- **KNN** was slower and less scalable with increasing data dimensions.

## Conclusion
The classification models revealed critical insights into the trade-offs between different algorithms in financial service contexts. **Random Forest** proved most robust for handling complex patterns and minimizing overfitting.
